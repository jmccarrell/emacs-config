# Spec intake for emacs-config

This skill governs the **first** phase of working on a spec: reading it, locating prior state, recognizing the shape, and framing my understanding back to Jeff before doing anything else.

The strongest signal that intake matters: spec 002 exists. "I don't like the change you made" is what happens when implementation runs ahead of alignment. Intake is the gate that prevents this.

## What intake produces

A chat message with three parts:

1. **What I understand the ask to be.** A one-paragraph paraphrase of the spec's intent in my own words. Not a quote — paraphrasing forces actual understanding.
2. **What I see in the current state.** What's already in the codebase, prior specs, prior implementations that this spec is reacting to or building on. Locating this state up front is what prevents pushback later.
3. **What's ambiguous or open.** The questions I'd want answered before proposing a decomposition. Could be scope, priority, or judgment calls I'd otherwise make alone.

What intake does **not** produce:

- Edits to tracked files
- Worktree requests
- Research write-ups (decomposition's job)
- Sub-goal proposals (decomposition's job)

## Workflow

### Step 0 — Confirm sync state

Before reading the spec, run read-only sync checks against both repos. Jeff works across multiple machines (see workspace `CLAUDE.md` "Multi-machine workflow"); planning a sub-goal against a stale view of the codebase is worse than 15 seconds of `git fetch`.

```sh
cd /Users/jeff/jwm/proj/emacs-config && git fetch && git status -sb
cd /Users/jeff/jwm/proj/emacs-config/literate-emacs.d/.bare && git fetch origin
cd /Users/jeff/jwm/proj/emacs-config/literate-emacs.d/main && git status -sb
# Repeat git status -sb in any other active feature worktree.
```

Report drift back to Jeff. If either repo is behind origin, recommend `git pull --ff-only` before proceeding. **Do not block** — Jeff decides whether to sync first or proceed against current state. The point is to surface drift, not to gate the workflow.

### Step 1 — Read the spec and its context

Read the spec itself. Then read referenced material:

- If the spec cites a prior spec by number ("I don't like the change in 001"), read that spec.
- If the prior spec was partially implemented, locate the implementation: `git log` of the relevant repo, current code state, any TASK.md still around in a worktree.
- If the spec uses pronouns or phrases that assume prior context ("the change you made", "that approach"), find what they refer to before framing.

### Step 2 — Recognize the shape

Read `/Users/jeff/jwm/proj/emacs-config/spec-shapes.md`. Use the recognition section to identify which shape this spec is — broad exploratory, narrow directive, pushback/redesign, or extension/refinement.

If the spec doesn't cleanly fit any shape, note that. It may be a new shape worth adding to `spec-shapes.md` later.

### Step 3 — Locate prior state per shape

Use the shape's framing-emphasis guidance from `spec-shapes.md` to drive what to look for. As orientation:

- **Broad exploratory** — usually little prior state; this is the start of new work.
- **Narrow directive** — grep the codebase for what the spec names. Often widens the scope.
- **Pushback/redesign** — find what was implemented in response to the parent spec. The diff is the most important thing to surface.
- **Extension/refinement** — find the in-flight plan being extended (chat history, open worktree's TASK.md, prior decomposition).

### Step 4 — Frame back

Default: write the three-part chat message and wait for Jeff's sign-off.

Skip framing only when the spec is genuinely unambiguous: a single-sentence directive with clear scope and no prior state to reconcile. Even then, prefer a one-line "I'll proceed to decomposition unless you'd like me to frame this back first" over silently moving on. The cost of an unnecessary framing message is small; the cost of skipping a needed one is spec 002.

### Step 5 — Wait

Do not move to investigation, decomposition, or worktree creation until Jeff signs off on the framing. Sign-off is usually short ("yes," "go," "looks right") but can include corrections that loop back to step 4.

When Jeff signs off, the next phase is decomposition — covered by `emacs-spec-decompose`.

## What to avoid

- **Implementing during intake.** No code changes, no `git add`, no worktree requests.
- **Skipping prior-state location.** This is what causes spec 002. If a spec references prior work, find it before framing.
- **Restating the spec verbatim.** Quoting back the spec doesn't prove understanding. Paraphrase.
- **Hiding ambiguity.** If something is open, list it. Don't make the judgment call silently.
- **Researching deeply.** Intake is fast — read the spec, find the prior state, frame back. Substantive investigation belongs to decomposition.
