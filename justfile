# Workspace-level recipes for managing reference Emacs configs.
#
# The registry of tracked repos lives in `reference-repos.list`
# (one line per repo: "name url last-known-sha"). Use the recipes
# below to read and modify it; don't edit the list by hand if you
# can avoid it.
#
# See `reference-configs.md` for what each tracked repo is for.

# Default: print the recipe list.
@_:
    just --list

# Print the current registry.
ref-list:
    @cat reference-repos.list

# Add a repo to the registry. The last-known-sha column starts as
# "-" until ref-update-inventory captures the current HEAD.
# Usage: just ref-add NAME URL

# upstream so it can detect "behind upstream" state. URL of "-"
# means a local-only repo (no upstream); those are noted but not
# acted on.

#
# Why this is a recipe and not a one-off: hooks live in .bare/hooks/
# which is not tracked by git (it's per-machine state on a fresh
# clone). The canonical source is hooks/pre-push at the workspace
# root, which IS tracked. This recipe copies the source into the
# install location and chmods it executable.
#
# Per-machine setup; rerun if you pull a change that touches
# hooks/pre-push to refresh the installed copy. Idempotent.
